                    <span>
                        Marching band is a unique and exciting activity with its combination of both music and visuals.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        While a significant time commitment, the hard work put in during practices really pays off. Marching band is a challenging but very rewarding experience. Finally seeing the show take shape after months of practice is a really great feeling and something to be proud of. 
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Because the band spends so much time together, new potential friends are everywhere. Marching band is a great way to get involved with the school as a freshman and make friends with older students who can be a guide in the new school.

                        Trips to places as a group are some of the most enjoyable parts of the marching band experience. Weekend band camp at Walden West and the trip to Disneyland were unforgettble and incredibly fun experiences with friends.
